# llm-samplers

Token samplers for large language models, written in Rust!

## Status

Extremely early in development, poorly tested. You can look at `src/tests.rs` for some examples of use.

Mirostat samplers soon hopefully.

## Credits

Initial version closely referenced from the samplers in the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) project (although not
a line-by-line port). Thanks!
